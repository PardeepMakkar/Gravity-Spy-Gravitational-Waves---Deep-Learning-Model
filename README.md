# Gravity-Spy-Gravitational-Waves---Deep-Learning-Model
Objective is to train the various Deep Learning Model which can classify the glitches present in the Gravity Spy dataset.

Gravity Spy is an innovative citizen-science meets Machine Learning meets gravitational waves physics project. 
LIGO, is the most sensitive and most complicated gravitational experiment ever created, is vulnerable to a great deal of instrumental
and environmental sources of noise called glitches. These glitches, are difficult to model using computers, can mimic true astrophysical signals,
and generally make LIGO less sensitive to gravitational waves. By selecting the right classification for a given glitch, one can help computers 
learn to do this classification themselves on much larger datasets, which helps scientists determine and eliminate the sources of noise.
